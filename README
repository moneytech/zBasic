zBasic is a minimal BASIC interpreter for embedded environments, compiling to
approx 5kB code on ARM THUMB. It is easily extended by writing C functions that
can be called from BASIC code.

The BASIC source is parsed and converted into byte code resulting in decent
performance.

$ make
$ make test
$ ./zbasic < basic/mandel.bas
